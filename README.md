Task - 03: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioural data. The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed

A decision tree classifier model is built to predict the employee attrition for the company. The dataset is used of IBM company employee attrition dataset from the Kaggle.
